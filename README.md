I strongly recommend you use PyCharm to run the program as there are setup files in the project folder. However, if you cannot use PyCharm, here are some dependencies you'll need:

- Python 3.12
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pandas.plotting
- sklearn or sci-kit learn
- sklearn.metrics

After you get the program running, a chart will pop up (there are three). Simply exit each one out to begin the program. Read the questions carefully and enjoy.
